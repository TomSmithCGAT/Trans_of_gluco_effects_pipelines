sRNA alignment Profiles
=======================

It is expected that the sRNA reads will align to particular locations
on the sRNA loci. For example, the majority of the sRNA reads aligning
to tRNA loci are expected to originate from 5â€²tRNA Halves in sperm
samples and hence they should align in the 5' half of the loci. In the
absence of differential expression, it's possible that changes in the
exact biogenesis of the sRNA could also be important. 

No quantification of differences between samples has been performed
here. However, it's clear from the plots below that the sRNA alignment
profiles is consistent between samples.

The following plots show the sRNA alignment profiles averaged over all
transcripts on a persample basis. The prefix of the filename above the plot
indicates the sRNA species. Analysis was performed sperately on all
samples and the F1 samples in isolation as specified in the filename
("F1" or "all"). The filename also contains the name of the aligner
("butter" or "bwa") used.
