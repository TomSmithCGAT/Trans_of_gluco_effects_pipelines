Differential expression analysis
================================

The following section presents Differential Expression (DE) analysis
of the sRNA-Seq expression data after performing the serial alignment
and quantification.

The plots below show expression against log-fold change, where
the log-fold change for loci with low expression has been adjusted to
reflect the lower accuracy of quantification. The raw fold-changes can
be viewed in the "unshrunken" plots.

There are no annotated miRNA, piRNA or tRNA genes which are identified
as differentially expressed in the F1 samples.
